**Recognizing of Handwritten digits**


In this ML system I, have done some recognizing of handwritten digits which includes the data called digits from the library called sklearn.
So, i made a model by using some algorithms:
   1. Support Vector Machine(SVM)
   2. Logostic Regression
   3. Decision Tree classifier
This all three algorithms belongs to the Classification Supervised Learning.


# So when i work with this three algorithms. 

* The Logistic Regression algorithm given the best performance with an accuracy of 97%.
* Support Vector machine(SVM) given the performance with an accuracy of 96%
* But the worst Performer was the Decision Tree Classifier with an accuracy of 85%


# SO i will come up with some new algorithms which can give  us approximate of 99 to 100%.
